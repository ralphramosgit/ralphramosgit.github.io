*Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works - Steve Jobs*

Developers are usually caught up with the idea that their design is all about the visual apeal and aesthetics, when in reality, design should be more about how it operates. When it comes to programming with JavaScript we can be too focused on just seeing how clean and short the code is. But this could lead into errors, maintainability issues, and lack of understanding of how our code works. 

When I first heard about TypeScript, I was both curious and cautious. Coming from a background of JavaScript and Python since high school, I wondered how much more of a difference a type system could make in a language that extends from JavaScript. When I dove deeper into learning TypeScript, I started to feel that the language is more than just JavaScript with types. To me, it felt like a bridge connecting the flexibility of javascript and the reliability of more structured languages like Java or C++.

## JavaScript Looked Blurry
When I revisited JavaScript again after learning low-end programming languages like C and C++, I realized how much more difficult it is to understand  JavaScript code. JavaScript variables were like people you’ve met but you couldn’t remember their names. It felt as if I had to guess and trust that the code will work like how I didn’t have to specify what data type a variable was and let the machine do its job. Deep down it felt morally wrong and that I didn’t feel like a true programmer. It felt like I was a cheating programmer. Overall, JavaScript just look blurry.

## TypeScript vs. JavaScript: Types Cleared the Blur
With JavaScript, I found myself spending more time on figuring out what types of values were being used and how they interacted within the code. This often led to unexpected bugs and I would lose my train of thought within the logic. Luckily with TypeScript, it reduces the ambiguity and makes the code more predictable. It’s as if I was able to read my opponent's next moves in chess. This added structure which allowed me to write more reliable and maintainable code. With the types added, I could look back at my code and easily retrace rather than having to guess. Additionally, TypeScript’s support for features like interfaces and type aliases helped me with organizing code better. In comparison to JavaScript where managing complex data structures usually involves manual checks or additional arrangements.Lastly,  I was able to understand TypeScript's errors better since it was more clear compared to the JavaScript errors. For example, there were errors like type mismatches and potential issues at compile time unlike JavaScript where errors only occur during execution and can be less descriptive.

## Do I Recommend TypeScript?
From a software engineering perspective, TypeScript feels like a smart progression from JavaScript. It doesn’t force heavy constraints yet it’s able to be specific and offers enough structure to effectively reduce errors. It’s a language that allows for both flexibility and reliability which makes it a good fit for projects especially those that could be on a larger scale. If you already have a familiarity with JavaScript, encounter unclear errors,want to be more enhanced with structures, then TypeScript would be a great choice

## Strengthening  My Software Engineering Skills
In terms of the WOD's, I truly believe that it will help me become a better software engineer overtime. My experience with the first WOD made me realize how much catching up I need to do. I was stressed at first since I wasn’t able to finish on time and that I would run into issues. When I managed to finish on time and get the right answer, I felt a sense of accomplishment and became eager to tackle more problems. To me, practicing WODs is like a game that you need to grind and level up. It’s a puzzle but this time I actually benefit from it by enhancing my critical thinking and coding skills. Hopefully in the future, it helps me pass my technical interview questions and land a job.

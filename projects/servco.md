### SERVCO Contact Our Team Page
During my Software Developement Internship, I contributed in creating a page where users can contact the staffs at SERVCO. 
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="img-fluid" src="../img/scDemo.png" >
</div>
## Features:
The page shows a list of the staffs with their names, profile pictures, and job position. There are filteres to filter out the staffs. Filters include store location, department they work in such as management, 
sales, services or parts. When clicking on the contact button, it shows their contact card, their phone number, email, and job position.


## My contribution to the project:
I helped format the frontend displaying the staff pictures and filters. I wrote the code to match the wanted 
design according to my UI/UX designer. I worked on the backend to pull data from workday and filter out which 
staffs to disply based on their location. I also helped create the contact cards and some of the filter buttons.

## A Laulima Chrome Extension to create a TODO list of assignments.

### PROBLEM:
A problem I was facing was having trouble making a TODO list whenever I would go to laulima. It was too much of a hassle of typing the list of my phone or using another application on my computer to make a TODO list for my homework. I didn't like having to look at my phone to see where I gathered all of my TODO's.

### SOLUTION:
I created a laulima chrome extension where you can add and delete TODO's. The TODO's input would include the homework name, the details about the homeowrk / TODO, and finally you can select on the calendar when the due date is for that assignment. The list is organized from the earlier due dates to the later due dates.

### TECHNOLOGIES:
HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, JSON

### Why LimaNotes:
Having LimaNotes helps you stay productive and be mindful of what assignments are due. When you hop on google chrome, log in to laulima, you can easily organize the notes all in one screen and application. You can finally see all the homework assignments that are due all in one place instead of going to individual class links.

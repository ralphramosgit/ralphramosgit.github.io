In short, this project helps answer COVID-19 concerns through chatting with a chatbot named Covey. Questions about symptoms, vaccines, and additional CDC resources. There are also features where you can upload your vaccine card and provides additional official resources.
(THIS PROJECT DOES NOT USE AI)
The input of questions and answers are all hardcoded into arrays where it checks if a certain word is detected within that array. I was a high schooler at the time and so I didn't have much knowledge of coding.

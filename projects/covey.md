summary: "A COVID-19 Chatbot to answer COVID concerns"
---
In short, this project helps answer COVID-19 concerns through chatting with a chatbot named Covey. Questions about symptoms, vaccines, and additional CDC resources. There are also features where you can upload your vaccine card and provides additional official resources.
``` THIS PROJECT DOES NOT USE AI
```the input of questions and answers are all hardcoded into arrays where it checks if a certain word is detected within that array. (I was a high schooler at the time and so I didn't have much knowledge of coding)
